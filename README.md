# Arcade-Bootleg-Hack-mra
Modified MRA files based on Jotego Arcade CPS1, CPS1.5, CPS2 and others.

## CPS 0

- re-write Jotego's 1942 HBMame MRAs. Now should be worked fine. 1943 also.


## CPS 1

- Three wonders Ex Super Version 3wonders01 hbmame.
- Street Fighter II CE Koryux sfrces15 hbmame.
- Street Fighter II CE Koryu sfrces22 hbmame.
- Street Fighter II CE Super Golden sfreds05 hbmame.
- Street Fighter II CE SHENG LONG sf2sl73a hbmame.



## CPS 1.5

- Sangokushi II SAN JIAN SHENG Asia (warriors of fate asia ver. bootleg) sk2h23 hbmame.
- - Sangokushi II Asia mame rom. Amended jotego file. Now, it can work! You can see the backgrounds! : )

  
## CPS 2

- Street Fighter Alpha 3 Xiang Long edition sfa3dp hbmame.
- Street Fighter Alpha 3 Dragon Drop Simplified sfa3s10 hbmame.
- Add 1944 (Strongest Fire Power), 19XX (Ex Super Version), AVP (Ultimate Evolution Edition) , PROGEAR (Halfway to Hell - Progear Red Label, Crazy Fire Version V1), hbmame.
- So CPS2 games, sometimes, you need use correct 'key'. That means, some hacks based on phoenix bootleg (or others). You need change the 'key' (yes, and some main cpu) to the correct one to make it work on MiSTer. 


## CAVE

- Gaia Crusaders (Enable Secret Character) gaias01, hbmame.
- Thunder Heroes (Select Characters 2009-08-19) theroes01, hbmame.


# NOTICE
- You must download CORRECT roms! Put the zip file in /GAMES/HBMAME/. Not in /GAMES/MAME/ folder!
- The mra file named as folder in the hbmame. You should found a same folder. So, that is the correct hbmame file you downloaded. (can also check the CRC, to make sure you downloaded correct ones.)
